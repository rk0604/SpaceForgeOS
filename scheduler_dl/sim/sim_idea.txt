timestamp
# Global simulation step number (e.g., 0, 1, 2...). Advances once per tick.

task_id
# Unique identifier for the full manufacturing process of one wafer or chip unit (e.g., T001). Groups all task phases.

task_phase_id
# Unique ID for the current phase of a task (e.g., T001_deposition). Treated as the atomic unit of scheduling.

task_phase_name
# Name of the current manufacturing phase being executed (e.g., "deposition", "ion_implantation", "crystal_growth").

phase_time_remaining(min) - minutes
# Number of simulation steps left to complete this phase.

phase_power_demand(w) - watts
# Amount of power (in watts or units) required per step to execute this phase.

phase_power_used(w) - watts
# Actual power used this step. Could be lower than demand if power is limited.

phase_energy_used_total(w) - watts
# Cumulative power consumed by this task_phase_id since it began.

battery_level - % value
# Current battery reserve level after this task phase's power draw.

task_phase_status
# Current execution state of the phase: "waiting", "processing", "done", or "power_blocked".

failure_event
# 0 or 1. Indicates whether a system or phase failure occurred at this step.

orbital_phase
# "sunlight" or "eclipse", based on orbital conditions. Affects available power.

task_queue_snapshot
# List of active task_ids in the queue at this timestep. Shows scheduling context (e.g., ['T002', 'T003']).

task_throughput_counter
# Cumulative number of completed task_ids (i.e., full wafer jobs). Used as reward for throughput optimization.

# Tasks simulated: deposition, ion implantation, and crystal growth â€” representing core energy-intensive processes in orbital semiconductor manufacturing.
